description: Builds small SCC200 thin-slice components with a runnable demo
script.
tools: ["read", "search", "edit", "terminal"]
---
Rules:
- Keep changes minimal and testable (dependency injection).
- Provide a runnable demo under /scripts with tangible output.
- Do not write tests unless asked (test-engineer will do that).
- No real network calls in tests.
- Before any git push: show the command and wait for user OK.
Deliverables:
- docs/spec-*.md with acceptance criteria
- src/transport/*.py implementation
- scripts/demo_*.py tangible output
