# Running LancasterLink Locally

Follow these steps to run the project on your machine.

1. Install Node.js
    - Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.
    - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
2. Navigate to the Frontend Folder
    - in a terminal, run: `cd frontend`
    - so you should be in `LancasterLink\frontend>`
3. Install Dependencies
    - If this is your first time running it then, in the same terminal run: `npm install`
    - You only need to do this when:
        - The `package.json` file changes
        - The `node_modules` folder is deleted
4. Start the Development Server
    - Run: `npm run dev`
    - You should see something like: `Local: http://localhost:3000`
    - Open that link in your browser.
